# Comprehensive Analysis Report: SpotV2Net Implementation Review
## Deep Comparison of 30-Minute Intraday vs Daily Volatility Forecasting

---

## Executive Summary

We have successfully transformed SpotV2Net from a **daily volatility prediction system** to a **30-minute intraday high-frequency forecasting system**. This represents a fundamental shift in temporal granularity, increasing from ~1,650 daily predictions to ~21,450 intraday predictions over the 6+ year period.

### Key Achievements
✅ **13x Higher Temporal Resolution**: 30-minute intervals vs daily  
✅ **Proper Yang-Zhang Implementation**: Handles intraday volatility correctly  
✅ **Scalable Architecture**: Processes 6+ years of minute-level data efficiently  
✅ **Rigorous Evaluation Framework**: QLIKE, MSE, MAE with proper transformations  
✅ **Statistical Testing**: MCS and DM tests adapted for intraday data  

### Critical Differences from Original
⚠️ **Temporal Frequency**: 30-min vs daily (fundamental change)  
⚠️ **Data Volume**: 21,450 vs 1,650 matrices  
⚠️ **Model Complexity**: Intraday patterns vs daily patterns  
⚠️ **Evaluation Scope**: Different statistical properties

### 1.2 Key Scripts Alignment

```python
# OUR IMPLEMENTATION FLOW (30-minute)
1_fetch_polygon_data.py       → Downloads 1-min data (2019-2025)
2_organize_prices_as_tables.py → Aggregates to 30-min, calculates Yang-Zhang
3_create_matrix_dataset.py     → (Mostly handled by script 2)
4_standardize_data.py          → Log-transform + standardization
5_train_SpotV2Net.py          → GAT model training
5_train_LSTM.py               → LSTM baseline
6_evaluate_all_models.py      → Comprehensive evaluation

# ORIGINAL NOTEBOOK (Daily)
6_results.ipynb               → Daily evaluation with different models
```

### 1.3 Dataset Classes

**Our Implementation:**
```python
# Specialized for intraday data
IntradayVolatilityDataset(
    seq_length=42,           # 42 thirty-min intervals
    intervals_per_day=13,    # Market hours: 9:30-16:00
    split='train/val/test',
    train_ratio=0.6,
    val_ratio=0.2
)
```

**Original Implementation:**
```python
# Daily data approach
CovarianceLaggedDataset(
    seq_length=42,           # 42 days
    split_proportion=0.8     # 80/20 split only
)
```

## 2. TEMPORAL ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS

### 2.1 Data Splits

| Split | Our Implementation | Original | Alignment |
|-------|-------------------|----------|-----------|
| **Training** | 60% (~12,870 samples) | 80% (~1,320 samples) | ❌ Different |
| **Validation** | 20% (~4,290 samples) | None (uses test as val) | ❌ Different |
| **Test** | 20% (~4,290 samples) | 20% (~330 samples) | ✅ Same ratio |
| **Total** | ~21,450 matrices | ~1,650 matrices | ❌ 13x difference |

### 2.2 Temporal Structure

**30-Minute Intervals (Our Implementation):**
```
Trading Day: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM
Intervals: [9:30-10:00], [10:00-10:30], ..., [3:30-4:00]
Total: 13 intervals per day
Sequence: 42 intervals ≈ 3.2 trading days
```

**Daily (Original):**
```
One observation per trading day
Sequence: 42 days ≈ 2 months
```

### 2.3 Critical Insight: Different Prediction Horizons

- **Our Model**: Predicts next 30 minutes (ultra short-term)
- **Original**: Predicts next day (short-term)
- **Economic Interpretation**: Completely different use cases!

## 3. EVALUATION METRICS DEEP DIVE

### 3.1 Metrics Implementation Comparison

| Metric | Our Implementation | Original Notebook | Correctness |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **MSE** | After inverse transform | Direct calculation | ✅ Ours better |
| **RMSE** | √MSE in real scale | √MSE in scaled space | ✅ Ours better |
| **QLIKE** | On variance with inverse transform | Direct on predictions | ✅ Ours correct |
| **MAE** | Real volatility scale | Not consistently used | ✅ Ours complete |

### 3.2 QLIKE Implementation Analysis

**Our Implementation (CORRECT):**
```python
# From utils/evaluation_intraday.py
def calculate_qlike(var_pred_real, var_true_real):
    # 1. Inverse transform to real variance
    # 2. Apply QLIKE formula: σ̂²/σ² - ln(σ̂²/σ²) - 1
    # 3. Ensures economic interpretation
    ratio = var_pred_real / var_true_real
    qlike = np.mean(ratio - np.log(ratio) - 1)
```

**Original Notebook:**
```python
def qlike(y, yhat):
    return y/yhat - np.log(y/yhat) - 1
    # Missing: Check if y, yhat are variances or volatilities
    # Missing: Inverse transformation from scaled space
```

### 3.3 Inverse Transformation (CRITICAL)

**Our Implementation:**
```python
# Proper chain of inverse transformations
Scaled predictions → Inverse standardize → Inverse log → Real variance
```

**Original:**
```python
# Partial transformation
predictions * std + mean  # Missing log transform handling
```

## 4. MODEL EVALUATION RESULTS

### 4.1 Models Compared

| Our Implementation | Original Notebook | Note |
|--------------------|-------------------|------|
| Naive Persistence | ✅ | Baseline |
| Historical Mean | ❌ (ARFIMA instead) | Different baseline |
| HAR-Intraday | HAR | Adapted for 30-min |
| LSTM | LSTM | Same architecture |
| SpotV2Net (GAT) | GAT with/without edges | Same core model |
| - | XGBoost | Not implemented yet |

### 4.2 Expected Performance Patterns

**30-Minute Predictions (Ours):**
- Higher RMSE values (more volatility in 30-min)
- Lower R² (harder to predict short-term)
- QLIKE more sensitive to rapid changes
- Naive baseline harder to beat

**Daily Predictions (Original):**
- Lower RMSE (smoothed daily averages)
- Higher R² (more predictable patterns)
- QLIKE reflects daily risk
- Models show clearer improvement

---

## 5. STATISTICAL TESTING ALIGNMENT

### 5.1 Model Confidence Set (MCS)

**Implementation:** ✅ Both use same MCS approach
**Difference:** Data shape - we reshape to (n_samples, 30)

### 5.2 Diebold-Mariano (DM) Test

**Implementation:** ✅ Both use multivariate version
**Our Adaptation:**
```python
# Reshape for 30 stocks
y.reshape(-1, 30)  # Each row = one time point, 30 stocks
```

**Key Insight:** Statistical tests remain valid but interpret different phenomena:
- **Ours**: Tests 30-min ahead forecast accuracy
- **Original**: Tests daily forecast accuracy

## 8. CONCLUSION

### What We've Achieved:
We have successfully transformed SpotV2Net from a **daily volatility forecasting system** to a **high-frequency 30-minute intraday prediction system**. This is not just a simple adaptation but a fundamental reimplementation that:

1. **Increases temporal resolution by 13x**
2. **Handles completely different volatility dynamics**
3. **Requires different evaluation paradigms**
4. **Opens new applications** (intraday trading, risk management)

### Key Insight:
**We are solving a DIFFERENT PROBLEM than the original paper:**
- **Original**: "What will tomorrow's daily volatility be?"
- **Ours**: "What will volatility be in the next 30 minutes?"

Both are valuable, but they serve different purposes and cannot be directly compared.

### Final Recommendation:
**Continue with the 30-minute implementation** as it provides:
- More granular risk management
- Real-time trading applications
- Richer dataset for deep learning
- Novel research contribution

However, **clearly document** that this is an intraday adaptation and results will differ from daily forecasting benchmarks.
