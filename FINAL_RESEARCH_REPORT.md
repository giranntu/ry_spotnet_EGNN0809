## üî¨ Training Performance Analysis

### SpotV2Net (Graph Attention Network)
- **Architecture**: 6-head GAT, [500] hidden layers, ReLU activation
- **Training**: 35 epochs with early stopping (best at epoch 25)
- **Validation RMSE**: 0.658 (2023 data)
- **Test RMSE**: 0.955 (2024-2025 data)
- **Training Time**: ~5 minutes
- **Convergence**: Quick convergence but significant overfitting

### LSTM Baseline
- **Architecture**: 2-layer LSTM, 256 hidden units, 0.2 dropout
- **Training**: 100 epochs completed
- **Validation RMSE**: 0.240 (2023 data)
- **Test RMSE**: 0.734 (2024-2025 data)
- **Training Time**: ~15 minutes
- **Convergence**: Smooth convergence with less overfitting

## üìà Temporal Analysis

### Data Splits
- **Training**: 2019-2022 (967 samples, ~4 years)
- **Validation**: 2023 (252 samples, 1 year)
- **Test**: 2024-2025 (739 samples, ~1.5 years)

### Distribution Shift Evidence
The large gap between validation and test performance indicates significant market regime changes:
- **SpotV2Net**: Val 0.658 ‚Üí Test 0.955 (45% degradation)
- **LSTM**: Val 0.240 ‚Üí Test 0.734 (206% degradation)

This suggests the 2024-2025 period exhibits different volatility dynamics than the training period.

## üéØ Critical Analysis

### Why Simple Models Outperformed

1. **Non-stationarity**: Financial markets in 2024-2025 behaved differently than 2019-2023
2. **Overfitting**: Neural networks memorized training patterns that didn't generalize
3. **Persistence in Volatility**: Volatility clustering is so strong that yesterday's volatility is the best predictor
4. **Standardization Effects**: The standardization process may have removed important scale information

### Model-Specific Issues

#### SpotV2Net Challenges:
- Graph construction may not capture true market dependencies
- Attention mechanism might be focusing on spurious correlations
- Limited by small dataset size (967 training samples)
- May need different edge features or graph topology

#### LSTM Challenges:
- Flattening covariance matrices loses structural information
- Sequential processing may not capture cross-sectional dependencies
- High parameter count (23MB model) relative to data size

## üìä Detailed Metrics Interpretation

### QLIKE (Quasi-Likelihood)
- Naive: 1.421 (best)
- SpotV2Net: 2.916
- LSTM: 7.915 (worst)

Lower is better. Measures forecast accuracy for volatility, penalizing both over and under-predictions asymmetrically.

### Mincer-Zarnowitz Regression (MZ-Œ≤)
- Ideal value: 1.0 (unbiased forecast)
- Naive: 0.993 (nearly perfect)
- HAR: 1.007 (excellent)
- LSTM: 1.385 (overestimating)

### Mean Directional Accuracy (MDA)
- Naive: 98.37% (exceptional)
- HAR: 92.97% (very good)
- SpotV2Net: 30.28% (poor)

Critical for trading strategies - shows ability to predict volatility increases/decreases.

## üöÄ Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Data Enhancement
- Include more recent data (post-2023) in training
- Add exogenous variables (VIX, macro indicators)
- Use higher frequency data (5-minute or tick)
- Implement online learning for adaptation

### 2. Model Architecture
- **SpotV2Net**: Try dynamic graph construction, different attention mechanisms
- **LSTM**: Preserve matrix structure with Conv-LSTM or tensor methods
- Consider transformer architectures for long-range dependencies
- Implement ensemble methods combining neural and econometric models

### 3. Training Strategy
- Use rolling window validation
- Implement adversarial training for robustness
- Apply stronger regularization (L1/L2, dropout)
- Use curriculum learning (easy to hard samples)

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Include realized volatility measures
- Add jump components
- Incorporate options-implied information
- Use sector/industry factors

## üí° Research Insights

### Key Learnings

1. **Simplicity Often Wins**: In volatile, changing markets, simple models can outperform complex ones
2. **Regime Changes Matter**: Models trained on one market regime may fail in another
3. **Graph Structure Critical**: The success of GNNs heavily depends on graph construction
4. **Volatility Persistence Strong**: The clustering effect in volatility is the dominant predictable pattern

### Future Research Directions

1. **Adaptive Models**: Develop models that can detect and adapt to regime changes
2. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine econometric insights with deep learning flexibility
3. **Interpretability**: Use attention weights to understand cross-asset dependencies
4. **Real-time Learning**: Implement online learning for continuous adaptation

## üìà Visualization Analysis

The prediction plots reveal:
- **Naive/HAR**: Track actual volatility closely with minimal lag
- **EWMA**: Smoothed predictions, missing sharp movements
- **LSTM/SpotV2Net**: Often predict constant values, failing to capture dynamics

## üìù Conclusion

While the SpotV2Net Graph Attention Network showed promise during validation, both neural network approaches struggled with the 2024-2025 test period. The dominance of simple persistence models suggests that:

1. **Market efficiency in volatility forecasting remains strong**
2. **Complex models require larger datasets and careful regularization**
3. **Regime changes pose significant challenges for static models**
4. **Future work should focus on adaptive, regime-aware architectures**

The research successfully implemented a complete volatility forecasting pipeline and provides valuable insights for future graph-based financial modeling efforts.
