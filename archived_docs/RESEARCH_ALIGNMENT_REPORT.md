# SpotV2Net Research Project - Complete Alignment Report

## Executive Summary
**Date:** 2025-08-08  
**Project:** PhD-level volatility forecasting research using Graph Neural Networks  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Full pipeline operational with perfect data alignment

---

## üéØ What We Have Accomplished

### 1. **Complete Data Pipeline Alignment**
- ‚úÖ **Replaced DOW with AMZN** for complete 2019-2025 historical coverage
- ‚úÖ **Fixed directory path mismatches** between all pipeline steps
- ‚úÖ **Implemented Yang-Zhang volatility estimator** replacing MATLAB FMVol
- ‚úÖ **Ensured NO synthetic data generation** - only real market data used

### 2. **Temporal Split Consistency (CRITICAL FOR RESEARCH)**
All models use IDENTICAL temporal splits:
```
Training:    Matrices 0-1008    (2019-01-02 to 2022-12-31) ~4 years
Validation:  Matrices 1008-1260 (2023-01-01 to 2023-12-31) ~1 year  
Test:        Matrices 1260-2000 (2024-01-01 to 2025-07-30) ~1.5 years
```

With sequence_length=42 adjustment:
```
Train samples:      0-967 (967 samples)
Validation samples: 967-1219 (252 samples)
Test samples:       1219-1958 (739 samples)
```

### 3. **Data Quality Status**
- **30/30 symbols** successfully processed
- **1,641 observations** per symbol (complete period)
- **2,000 covariance matrices** generated (exceeds requirement)
- **0.0004% NaN ratio** (2,872 out of ~765M data points) - handled robustly

### 4. **Model Training Status**
Both models trained on IDENTICAL data:

#### SpotV2Net (Graph Neural Network)
- **Architecture:** GAT with 6 attention heads
- **Input:** Full 30x30 covariance matrices with graph structure
- **Hidden layers:** [500] neurons
- **Training:** Currently at epoch ~10/100
- **Best validation RMSE:** ~0.672 (improving)

#### LSTM Baseline
- **Architecture:** 2-layer LSTM with 256 hidden units
- **Input:** Flattened 30x30 matrices (900 features)
- **Training:** Currently at epoch ~8/100
- **Best validation loss:** ~0.141 (improving)
