## 📈 Key Observations

### Strengths:
1. **Complete Pipeline**: All data processing steps working correctly
2. **Proper Temporal Splits**: No data leakage (Train: 2019-2022, Val: 2023, Test: 2024-2025)
3. **Early Stopping**: SpotV2Net properly stopped to prevent overfitting
4. **Checkpointing**: Both models saved at best performance
5. **Reproducibility**: Fixed seeds and documented configurations

### Areas Noted:
1. **LSTM Outperforming GNN**: LSTM shows better validation performance (0.25 vs 0.658)
2. **Test Set Distribution Shift**: Higher test RMSE indicates 2024-2025 volatility patterns differ
3. **SpotV2Net Convergence**: Model converged quickly (best at epoch 25/100)
