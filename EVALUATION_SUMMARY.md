- **Architecture**: Graph Attention Network (GAT)
- **Key Features**:
  - 6 attention heads
  - Established benchmark model
- **Performance**: Solid but outperformed by newer architectures

## Technical Analysis

### Why PNA Excels
1. **Multi-scale Aggregation**: Captures different statistical moments of volatility spillovers
2. **Degree-aware Processing**: Accounts for fully connected nature of financial networks
3. **Variance-aware Features**: Specifically designed for volatility (2nd moment) prediction

### Data Characteristics
- **Log-transformed standardized data**: Mean = -15.56, Std = 0.95
- **30-minute intervals**: 13 intervals per trading day
- **Feature dimensions**: 84 features (42 timesteps √ó 2 features: vol + vol-of-vol)
- **Graph structure**: Fully connected 30 DOW stocks

## Recommendations

### For Production Deployment
‚úÖ **Deploy PNA model** as primary volatility forecaster
- Best overall performance (QLIKE = 0.1266)
- 62.5% improvement over naive baseline
- Robust to market conditions

### For Ensemble Approach
Consider combining top 3 models:
1. PNA (weight: 0.5)
2. TransformerGNN (weight: 0.3)
3. SpotV2Net (weight: 0.2)

### Future Improvements
1. **Hyperparameter tuning**: PNA could potentially reach QLIKE < 0.12
2. **Ensemble methods**: Combine PNA + TransformerGNN
3. **Temporal attention**: Add specific market regime awareness
